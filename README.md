# Project Description

The problem statement in this code is to implement a simple neural network and train it to perform logical XOR operations. The neural network has an input layer with 2 nodes, a hidden layer with 4 nodes, and an output layer with 1 node. The code uses a sigmoid activation function and its derivative for the network's activation.

Several principles related to programming languages and neural network implementation are used in our code:

1. Abstraction:
   - The code uses a struct (`NeuralNetwork`) to encapsulate the properties and behavior of a neural network. This is an example of abstraction, where the complexity of the neural network is hidden behind a simplified interface.

2. Functional Programming:
   - The code utilizes functional programming concepts, such as defining functions (sigmoid, sigmoid_derivative) that operate on input parameters without modifying state. Functional programming principles often emphasize immutability and pure functions, which can enhance code clarity and maintainability.

3. Modularity:
   - The code breaks down the functionality of the neural network into modular components. For example, the `train` function handles the training process, and the `predict` function handles making predictions. This modular design contributes to code organization and reusability.

4. Generics:
   - The use of generic types is not explicitly present in this code. However, the code leverages the Rust programming language's ability to work with generic data types and functions, contributing to flexibility and code reuse.

5. Imperative and Declarative Styles:
   - The code primarily follows an imperative style, especially in the training function where it explicitly defines the steps of forward pass, backward pass (`backpropagation`), and weight updates. Neural network code often involves a mix of imperative and declarative styles.

6. Lifetime Annotations:
   - Rust-specific lifetime annotations are used to manage reference lifetimes and guarantee memory safety when references are used in function parameters ({&Vec\Vec<f64>>}).

7. Mutable State and In-Place Updates:
   - In order to modify the weights of the neural network, the training method ('train') uses in-place updates and mutable state ('&mut self'). This demonstrates how the ownership concept in Rust allows for safe, flexible data access.

8. Time Measurement:
   - The code uses the ‘Instant’ type from the ‘std::time’ module to measure the duration of the training process. This illustrates how time-related operations are supported by Rust's standard library.
 
These principles contribute to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, aligning with the broader principles of programming languages. Additionally, the specific principles of neural network implementation, such as backpropagation for training, are reflected in the code to achieve the desired learning behavior
